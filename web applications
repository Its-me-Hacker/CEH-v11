*******Footprint the web infrastructure**********

<<Perform web application reconnaissance>>
Use tools such as Netcraft (https://www.netcraft.com), 
SmartWhois (https://www.tamos.com), 
WHOIS Lookup (http://whois.domaintools.com), 
Batch IP Converter (http://www.sabsoft.com) to perform the Whois lookup.

Use tools such as Professional Toolset (https://tools.dnsstuff.com), 
DNSRecon (https://github.com), and 
DNS Records (https://network-tools.com), 
Domain Dossier (https://centralops.net) to perform DNS interrogation.

<<Perform web application reconnaissance using WhatWeb>>
whatweb -h (for help)
whatweb www.test.com (to perform website footprinting on the target website.)
whatweb -v www.test.com ( to run a verbosity scan on the target website.)
whatweb --log-verbose=MovieScope_Report www.moviescope.com ( to export the results returned by WhatWeb as a text file.)

<<Perform web spidering using OWASP ZAP>>

<<Detect load balancers using various tools>>
dig test.com (displaying the available load balancers of the target website)
lbd test.com (displaying the available DNS load balancers used by the target website)

<<Identify web server directories>>
nmap -sV --script=http-enum [target domain or IP address] (displaying open ports and services, along with their version)

gobuster dir -u [Target Website] -w /home/attacker/Desktop/common.txt (displaying the identified web server directories)

***********Perform web application attacks**************

<<Perform a brute-force attack using Burp Suite>>

<<Perform parameter tampering using Burp Suite>>

<<Exploit parameter tampering and XSS vulnerabilities in web applications>>

<<Perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack>>
wpscan --api-token [API Token from Step#25] --url http://target-ip:port/CEH --plugins-detection aggressive --enumerate vp
Once you have found vulnerable plugins then send script to victim,
Once the victim click on that shared script its perform CSRF.
